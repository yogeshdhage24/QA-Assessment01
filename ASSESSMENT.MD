# QA Engineer Assessment

## Introduction

This is the FedEx Digital International QA Engineer assessment. The purpose is to give us
insight in your technical abilities, development approach and general technical
working habits. We view your performance on this assessment as indicative of
the work you will deliver as a QA Engineer.

Good luck!

## Tips

* Choose an IDE to your liking (We recommend the Free Micrsoft Visual Studio Code)
* It should not take more than a three to four hours to demonstrate your skills with this project
* If you get stuck (especially with the app itself or installations), please contact us
* Refactor and restructure anything in the project if you think that works better
* When you `npm start` the application know that `npm run e2e` will start it again (and fail). So kill a running application if startup fails.
* We have left the angular + cypress builder configuration empty in angular.json file, we'll leave it to you to update it

Please provide your documentation in the [ASSESSMENT-SOLUTION.MD](./ASSESSMENT-SOLUTION.MD) file.
